### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Alex and I am a Language Engineer from Stuttgart, Germany. Since 2015 I am working for the Itemis AG in Stuttgart and am developing mainly languages
aka [Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for mostly non programmers.

I have created a particular interest about building DSLs with so called "language workbenches" and projectional editors. For more details on this topic check out the publications of a colleague of mine [Markus Voelter](https://voelter.de/publications.html). 
My daily work is mainly done with [Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) which is one of the most relevant Language Workbench available at the moment.

If you are interested in this topic and want to have look at some stuff me and my colleagues are working on, check out the
following open-source projects on github:

* [MPS-Extensions](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS-extensions)
* [IETS3](https://github.com/IETS3/iets3.opensource)
* [Mbeddr](https://github.com/mbeddr)
* [modelix](https://github.com/modelix/modelix)

If you have any questions about the stuff I am working on or  [Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) in general, feel free to ping me.
